      <p>The player has to choose 5 five colors from the above 8 colors to break
        the secret color combination.
      </p>
      <p>For every guess you will get result of the guess as red and white pegs</p>
      <p>The white peg indicates that is a correct color but wrong position, or a
        red peg to indicate each peg is in a correct position and a right color.
      <p> If neither are true, then no peg should
        be
        placed.
      </p>
      The pegs may place in any order in the peg holes arranged in the square pattern next to the line
      of peg
      holes holding the guess pegs being answered.
      </p>

      <p>The answer and guess pegs stay in their positions until the end of the game.</p>
      <p>Play continues until the code is discovered or there are no remaining guesses.</p>
